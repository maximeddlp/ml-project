School Projects - Data Science & Machine Learning
This repository contains several projects completed as part of my academic curriculum. The goal of these projects is to apply data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques to real-world datasets.

ncluded Projects
1. Bitcoin Price Prediction (Classification)

Description: Predicting Bitcoin price trends (UP/DOWN) over a 30-minute horizon.

Key Highlights:

Data cleaning and processing of historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.

Feature Engineering: Implementation of technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages.

Modeling: Performance comparison between classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM.

2. SNCF Delay Forecasting (Regression)

Description: Predicting train delays across the SNCF (French National Railway) network.

Key Highlights:

Handling complex time-series and categorical data.

Feature Engineering: Cyclic encoding of dates (sine/cosine transforms) and Target Encoding for high-cardinality categorical variables.

Modeling: Implementation of regression models such as LightGBM, Random Forest, and Ridge/Lasso regression.

Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning using BayesSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, Category Encoders, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
